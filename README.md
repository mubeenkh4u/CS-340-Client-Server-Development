# CS-340 Portfolio Repository

This repository contains two major projects developed during CS-340: Client/Server Development.

## Folders
- `crud_module/` — Python CRUD operations with MongoDB
- `interactive_dashboard/` — Dash dashboard connected to MongoDB

## Reflection
### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I structure code into clear, modular components, document each function, and prioritize clean naming conventions. The CRUD module, with distinct create() and read() methods, allowed seamless reuse across projects. This modularity supported rapid dashboard integration and would support easy future expansion to API services or full-stack apps.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I first break down requirements, identify core functionalities, and prototype early connections (e.g., database connectivity). For Grazioso Salvare, this meant first validating CRUD operations, then layering in visualizations. Compared to earlier projects, this approach prioritized real-time interactivity and database optimization.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by building robust, scalable, and user-centric technology solutions. In this project, the dashboard helps Grazioso Salvare make faster and better rescue decisions, demonstrating how thoughtful software engineering can save lives and improve operational efficiency.
